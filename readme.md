# Advent Of Code

[Advent Of Code](http://adventofcode.com) was daily code challenge during the Christmas period of 2015. All questions and its input are property of [Eric Wastl](http://was.tl).

This repository is just to keep the questions stored, so that I can solve them for fun, on my own pace.
